# Emoji cipher

The Emoji cipher is a very basic cipher.

Basically, we convert letters to emojis to encode a message, and we do the opposite operation to decode this encrypted message.

Here is the table:
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>A</th>
			<th>B</th>
			<th>C</th>
			<th>D</th>
			<th>E</th>
			<th>F</th>
			<th>G</th>
			<th>H</th>
			<th>I</th>
			<th>J</th>
			<th>K</th>
			<th>L</th>
			<th>M</th>
			<th>N</th>
			<th>O</th>
			<th>P</th>
			<th>Q</th>
			<th>R</th>
			<th>S</th>
			<th>T</th>
			<th>U</th>
			<th>V</th>
			<th>W</th>
			<th>X</th>
			<th>Y</th>
			<th>Z</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>😄</td>
