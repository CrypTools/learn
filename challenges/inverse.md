# Question:
If FIND is coded as URMW and ME is coded as NV, then **create a function that will reproduce this effect on any string**

## Help?
You should look at this alphabet table:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>A</th>
			<th>B</th>
			<th>C</th>
			<th>D</th>
			<th>E</th>
			<th>F</th>
			<th>G</th>
			<th>H</th>
			<th>I</th>
			<th>J</th>
			<th>K</th>
			<th>L</th>
			<th>M</th>
			<th>N</th>
			<th>O</th>
			<th>P</th>
			<th>Q</th>
			<th>R</th>
			<th>S</th>
			<th>T</th>
			<th>U</th>
			<th>V</th>
			<th>W</th>
			<th>X</th>
			<th>Y</th>
			<th>Z</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
<table>

## Requirements:

- Your program should be case **insensitive**, and return capital letters only.
- Your program should use this template:

```javascript
String.prototype.encrypt = function() {
    // to get the String you need to encrypt, use 'this'
}
```
