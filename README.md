## Welcome to the best platform to learn cryptography

> Cryptography is the art of writing and solving problems in order to prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages. And as any art, it can be taught. This was our mission by creating this platform. You'll have some challenges to complete, the first ones are easy, but don't worry, it will get much harder after some point.

## Create a challenge

- For JS questions, put your `.md` file in `/challenges` and use `_data/challenges.yml`
- For non JS questions, put your `.md` file in `/noob_questions` and use `_data/noob.yml`

### Write the question.
Try to follow the template we use in the other file (you're allowed to copy paste other questions and change the content if want).

### Write the answer
In the config file (in the `_data` folder), declare your file and your answer using the small template at the top of the file.

## Do a PR
You can contribute to our code, but here are some rules to follow before doing any PRs:
- Make sure that your code is indented with tabs instead of spaces
- For JavaScript code, use ES7, Babel will compile it to ES5.
